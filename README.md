# To do list

It was my first ever React project for an internship, I was approached with the following requirements:

1. On click Add the list shows a new task with the content “Task number #” where # is a task number. 
2. After repetitive Add clicking, the list gets filled with task, each of the task must have a higher number.
3. On click Remove removes the last task (the one with the highest number).
4. On click Clear removes all of the tasks from the list.
